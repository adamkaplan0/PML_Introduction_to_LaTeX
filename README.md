# Introduction to LaTeX

Materials for MIT Political Methodology Lab workshop introducing people to coding in LaTeX. The workshop covers a basic introduction to the LaTeX language, how to setup a LaTeX document, some key environments/commands, including figures/tables/code, and some troubleshooting advice. The slide deck also contains additional resources for including references through BibTeX and a quick introduction to create slide decks using Beamer. Practice files are provided, but I encourage everyone to go over the main slide deck to see how a rather complicated presentation is setup.

## Contents

All the practice (BibTeX and Beamer) materials are in the `practice` folder. The main presentation is `main.pdf`, its associated handout, `main-handout.pdf`, and the source code `main.tex` are located in the parent folder. Figures included in the presentation are in the `figures` folder.
